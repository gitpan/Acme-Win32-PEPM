=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is a packager that allows you to build a .pm that is simultaneously
a .pm that can be C<do>, C<require>d, or C<use>d, and the same .pm is a 100%
real DLL containing XS code. The generated file meets the file format standards
of both a .pm and a PE (Portable Executable) DLL and uses no temp files.
The author of this module sees this module as a joke since with this
"packager", the .pm text is stored uncompressed in the .dll, and there is no
sane reason to keep .pm text memory mapped into a process since after
parsing/compiling .pm, the .pm text is never referenced again, yet with this
"packager", if the XS DLL is loaded, so is the .pm text, into the process.

The resulting .pm that is built can not be edited even though it mostly looks
like plain text. If it is edited, the DLL will be corrupt. The resulting .pm,
although superficially looking like pure perl can not be moved between perl
installations/versions except for maint versions, since the XS DLL inside the
.pm, like all XS DLLs/SOs is bound to a particular perl installation and version
number.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 load

    Win32::PEPM::load(__FILE__, $VERSION);

Similar to L<XSLoader|XSLoader's> C<load> sub except takes a filename as first
arg. This file name must be the C<__FILE__> token.

what VC's C<-stub> is with C<ld>.
